# GoVet
GoVet is a mobile web application that aims at raising awareness about veteran 
considerations by gamifying and exposing them to veterans’ stories so that they 
better appreciate the veteran population in their local community.

### Team
*  Team Name: QRS
*  Team Members: Chris Davis, Jon Tara, Kim Tien Vu, Kimiko Okumura, Nicole Lee,
Pan Yeung, Rickesh Khilnani, Yuling Shi

## Project Ideas:
* What is the problem: How might we bring awareness to San Diego’s veteran 
population so that action can be taken?
* What it does: First scan QR code, then collect veteran trading cards to gain 
points to redeem for rewards!
* What did we learn: 
   * #breakitdown: organize problems into tractable components and design solutions
   * #purpose: Identify and evaluate underlying goals and the values on which they are based
   * #rightProblem: characterize the nature of the problem 
   * #evidenceBased: Identify and appropriately structure the information needed to support an argument effectively
   * #analogies: use analogy of the baseball trading cards
   * #constraints: time, money, learn skills given time constraint, domain knowledge limited
   * #communicationDesign, #multimedia
* What do we have accomplish: We have used Figma to design the User Interface,
  and react, PHP, WordPress, Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript to build the 
  front-end of the website. 
* What is the next: Further developing the selection algorithm, improving the 
design and layout of the website and the cards, incorporate more non-profit 
organizations and establishments that support veterans and give them 
benefits/discounts, attach a database to our project, encourage more businesses 
to partner with us so that there are more rewards for the general public, and 
encourage people to volunteer.
