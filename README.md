# GoVet
GoVet is a mobile web application that aims at raising awareness about veteran 
considerations by gamifying and exposing them to veterans’ stories so that they 
better appreciate the veteran population in their local community.

points to redeem for rewards!

   * #breakitdown: organize problems into tractable components and design solutions
   * #purpose: Identify and evaluate underlying goals and the values on which they are based

   * #evidenceBased: Identify and appropriately structure the information needed to support an argument effectively
   * #analogies: use analogy of the baseball trading cards
   * #constraints: time, money, learn skills given time constraint, domain knowledge limited
